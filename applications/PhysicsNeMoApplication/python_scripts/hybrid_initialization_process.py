"""Process warm-starting a solve from a trained model's prediction.

Runs one inference in ExecuteBeforeSolutionLoop and writes the predicted
fields (typically into historical solution-step variables) so the first
nonlinear solve starts from the ML prediction instead of a cold state,
reducing iteration counts — the "hybrid initialization" idea popularized by
NVIDIA's physicsnemo-cfd. This implementation performs a plain forward pass
through the model loaded via model_registry; to blend the prediction with a
second flow state through physicsnemo-cfd's own recipes, use cfd_bridge
(CreateFlowfield / CreateHybridInitialization / FlowfieldToModelPart).

Reuses all the gather/forward/scatter machinery of InferenceProcess.
