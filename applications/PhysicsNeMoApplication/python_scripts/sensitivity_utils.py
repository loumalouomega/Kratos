"""Design sensitivities: cheap surrogate gradients and exact adjoints.

Two complementary dJ/dx paths:

- **Surrogate path** (cheap, approximate): plain autograd through a
  deployed surrogate's forward - dJ/d(coordinates) are shape
  sensitivities, dJ/d(features) parameter sensitivities. Accuracy is the
  surrogate's; the DoMINO drag-adjoint workflow.
- **Exact adjoint path** (built on differentiable_residual): with the
  discrete state equations b(u, theta) = 0 and d b/d u = -K (the block
  builder's convention, pinned by differentiable_residual's tests), the
  chain rule gives

      dJ/dtheta = pJ/ptheta + lambda^T (pb/ptheta),   K^T lambda = pJ/pu

  One adjoint solve (scipy splu on the Dirichlet-applied tangent's
  transpose) covers every parameter; pb/ptheta comes from central finite
  differences over BuildRHS re-assemblies at FIXED state - cheap for a
  handful of scalar design parameters. The signs are pinned by a
  validation test against full finite differences through real solves,
  not trusted on paper.

OptimizationApplication/ShapeOptimizationApplication adjoints are the
classical baselines; they are not required (validation here is FD-based).
