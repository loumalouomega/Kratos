"""Differentiable shape deformation on Kratos meshes.

The design-parameterization layer: a small set of control parameters maps
differentiably to node coordinates, so gradients of a surrogate objective
flow back to the shape itself (physicsnemo >= 2.2's
physicsnemo.nn.functional deformers, Warp-accelerated on CUDA).

    control displacements --DeformPoints--> deformed coordinates
                                                |
                                     WriteNodeCoordinates
                                                |
                                        a moved Kratos mesh

Pair it with sensitivity_utils.ComputeShapeSensitivities to get dJ/d(control)
by the chain rule through a surrogate, and with RegularizationEnergy to keep
the deformed mesh valid (element inversion is the failure mode that ruins a
shape optimization run).

Two contracts worth stating up front, both easy to get wrong:

- **Control values are DISPLACEMENTS, not destination coordinates.** A zero
  control array is the identity deformation.
- **Coordinate write-back is the only mutating operation here.** Everything
  else is pure: it returns tensors and leaves the model part alone.

Mesh moving: writing coordinates directly is the right thing for a shape
parameterization of the *boundary and volume together* (FFD/RBF move every
node they cover). When only a surface should move and the interior should
follow smoothly, drive MeshMovingApplication with the resulting boundary
displacement instead of writing interior nodes here.

torch/physicsnemo are optional runtime dependencies - imported lazily.
