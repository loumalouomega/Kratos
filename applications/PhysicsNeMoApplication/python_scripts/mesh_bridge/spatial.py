"""Signed distance fields on Kratos meshes (physicsnemo >= 2.2).

An SDF turns geometry itself into a feature: every point carries its signed
distance to the boundary, which is what lets a surrogate generalize across
shapes instead of memorizing one mesh. This module computes it against a
model part's boundary and, crucially, delivers it the way the rest of the
application already consumes data.

The integration trick: `WriteSignedDistanceField` stores the result into an
ordinary nodal (non-historical) Kratos variable. Every gather in this
application - `grid_bridge.SampleFieldsOnGrid`, `graph_bridge.BuildGraph`,
`inference_process.GatherInputFields` - keys off
`(variable_name, data_location)`, so once the SDF is a variable it flows
into grids, graphs and point clouds through their existing `input_fields`
settings with no signature changes anywhere. `SampleSignedDistanceOnGrid`
covers the one case that cannot work that way: lattice points are not nodes.

Upstream contract, encoded here:

- **Negative inside, positive outside**, zero on the surface.
- It requires a **triangle surface in 3D** and rejects volume meshes, so a
  tetrahedral model part is reduced to its boundary surface first.
- Distances are computed in float32 internally (Warp-backed, CPU and CUDA);
  results are returned as float64 to match this application's convention.
- With `max_dist` set, queries beyond that band return NaN rather than a
  distance - a narrow-band optimization, not an error.

torch/physicsnemo are optional runtime dependencies - imported lazily.

    """The OUTWARD-oriented triangle surface of a mesh, as the SDF requires.

    A volume (tetrahedral) mesh is rejected by the SDF query, so its boundary
    is extracted here - but extraction alone is not enough: physicsnemo's
    Mesh.get_boundary_mesh() returns triangles with inconsistent winding (the
    closed surface's signed volume comes out 0 instead of the enclosed
    volume), and BOTH sign methods then give meaningless signs, reporting
    interior points as outside.

    So the boundary is rebuilt here with a consistent outward orientation,
    exactly rather than heuristically: a facet belongs to the boundary when it
    appears in a single cell, and its winding is fixed by requiring the normal
    to point AWAY from that cell's opposite vertex. The result satisfies
    signed-volume == enclosed volume, which the tests assert.

    Surface meshes are passed through untouched - their orientation is the
    caller's own.
