"""Exact NURBS geometry sampling - the isogeometric analogue of curved mode.

Kratos's NURBS geometries (IgaApplication meshes, or core
NurbsSurfaceGeometry3D / NurbsVolumeGeometry built directly) carry the exact
CAD geometry; nothing in the mesh bridge could see it, because IGA model
parts have no simplicial elements to tessellate. This module samples the
exact geometry on a structured parametric lattice - every point evaluated by
the C++ geometry's own GlobalCoordinates, never by an approximation - and
tessellates the lattice into the bridge's simplicial contract (triangles for
surfaces, Kuhn 6-tetrahedra for volumes, face-consistent across cells, so
the result is watertight by construction).

Fields in IGA live on CONTROL POINTS, and a control point is generally NOT
on the geometry - so a nodal gather makes no sense pointwise. The correct
gather is the isogeometric one: EvaluateNodalFieldOnLattice interpolates
control-point values through the geometry's own NURBS basis, obtained from
CreateQuadraturePointGeometries at the lattice's parametric coordinates -
the same the-C++-side-is-the-oracle policy the curved tessellation uses.
Sampled points are synthetic in the provenance sense: they interpolate on
gather and have no scatter-back (least-squares control-point recovery is a
fitting problem, deliberately out of scope).

Kratos stores NURBS knot vectors WITHOUT the first and last classical
repetition; the parametric domain is still [Knots[0], Knots[-1]], which is
what the lattice spans.

torch/physicsnemo are needed only by BuildNurbsMesh; sampling and field
evaluation are Kratos + numpy.
