"""Executes the shipped example notebooks.

`examples/notebooks` is the application's worked documentation: seventeen
notebooks calling the same public helpers the processes call. Nothing
executed them until this file existed, so a renamed argument or a changed
return type broke them silently - a static import check is not enough,
because every one of those names still resolves; it is the call signatures
and the behaviour that rot.

Each notebook runs in a throwaway copy of the tree rather than in place,
for two reasons. The notebooks write artifacts next to themselves
(`output/`, `*.pt`, `*.png`), which would dirty the working tree on every
run; and notebooks 16 and 17 load their solver cases from
`tests/kratos_solver_cases`, so the copy has to preserve the relative
layout, not just the notebook file.

The notebooks are slow by test standards (~5 minutes for all seventeen) and
are registered on the validation suite only.
