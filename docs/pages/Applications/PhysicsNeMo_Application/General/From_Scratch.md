# From scratch

This walks the whole path once, naming the exact module at every step. It is
deliberately the *simplest* version of each: a plain MLP, nodal fields, no
uncertainty, no distribution. Everything else in this documentation is a
variation on these five steps.

If PhysicsNeMo itself is new to you, read
[PhysicsNeMo Basics](../PhysicsNeMo_Basics/Overview.html) first. If you want to
know where a module lives, [Where things live](Module_Map.html).

**Prerequisites:** a Kratos build with this application and a solver
application (the examples below use `ConvectionDiffusionApplication`), plus
`pip install torch nvidia-physicsnemo`.

## The shape of it

```
 1. export     a real solve  ---> sample_0.npz, sample_1.npz, ...
 2. train      those files   ---> a torch model
 3. save       the model     ---> surrogate.pt + surrogate.pt.card.json
 4. deploy     the model     ---> predictions on Kratos nodes, in the loop
 5. validate   the loop      ---> numbers saying whether to believe it
```

## 1. Export training data from a real solve

Attach `dataset_export_process` to a solve you already have. It writes one
`.npz` per step with the fields you name, and imports no torch — you can run
this step on a machine with no ML stack at all.

```json
{
    "python_module" : "dataset_export_process",
    "kratos_module" : "KratosMultiphysics.PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes.export",
    "Parameters"    : {
        "model_part_name" : "ThermalModelPart",
        "list_of_fields"  : [
            { "variable_name" : "HEAT_FLUX",   "data_location" : "node_historical" },
            { "variable_name" : "TEMPERATURE", "data_location" : "node_historical" }
        ],
        "output_path"     : "dataset",
        "output_interval" : 1
    }
}
```

Run the solve — ideally several, sweeping whatever you want the surrogate to
generalize over (a boundary condition, a material parameter, a load). One solve
gives you one sample; a surrogate needs a family.

The field keys in the resulting files are `"<VARIABLE>__<location>"`, e.g.
`"TEMPERATURE__node_historical"`. You will need them in the next step.

*Variations:* `grid_dataset_export_process` resamples onto a voxel grid;
`mesh_export_process` writes a `.pmsh` series; `streaming_dataset_export_process`
skips the files entirely and trains out of the running solve.

## 2. Train

```python
import torch
import KratosMultiphysics as Kratos
from KratosMultiphysics.PhysicsNeMoApplication.training import torch_dataset, training_utils

dataset = torch_dataset.CreateNpzDataset(
    "dataset",
    input_keys=["HEAT_FLUX__node_historical"],
    output_keys=["TEMPERATURE__node_historical"])

model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(1, 64), torch.nn.Tanh(),
    torch.nn.Linear(64, 64), torch.nn.Tanh(),
    torch.nn.Linear(64, 1))

history = training_utils.TrainModel(model, dataset, Kratos.Parameters("""{
    "epochs"        : 500,
    "batch_size"    : 8,
    "learning_rate" : 1e-3,
    "echo_interval" : 50
}"""))
```

`CreateNpzDataset` yields `(inputs, targets)` as `(n_entities, width)` float32
tensors — **the same layout `inference_process` will feed the model at
deployment**. That correspondence is the whole reason the pieces fit together;
if you build a dataset by hand, match it.

A `torch.nn.Module` is fine here. Use a `physicsnemo.Module` (see
[Models](../PhysicsNeMo_Basics/Models.html)) when you want the architecture to
travel in the checkpoint.

*Variations:* `extra_loss_terms=` adds a physics residual to the objective
([Symbolic and physics](../PhysicsNeMo_Basics/Symbolic_And_Physics.html));
`epoch_callbacks=` lets you score the surrogate against the real PDE residual
while it trains.

## 3. Save it — with a card

```python
card = {
    "input_fields"  : [{"variable_name": "HEAT_FLUX",   "data_location": "node_historical"}],
    "output_fields" : [{"variable_name": "TEMPERATURE", "data_location": "node_historical"}],
    "notes"         : "swept HEAT_FLUX over [0, 1e4], 40 solves",
}
checkpoint_type = training_utils.SaveTrainedModel(model, "surrogate.pt", card=card)
```

**Do not skip the card.** It writes `surrogate.pt.card.json` next to the
checkpoint, recording what the channels mean, and every deployment process
validates its configuration against it. If you trained on normalized targets,
add `"output_normalization"` to the card — the deployment path then inverts the
scaling for you, instead of writing normalized numbers onto a physical variable
where they look plausible and are wrong by the training scaling.

## 4. Deploy it inside a solve

Attach `inference_process` to the analysis you want to accelerate. It gathers
the input fields, runs a no-grad forward pass, and writes the output back onto
real Kratos variables — after which nothing downstream can tell a predicted
value from a solved one.

```json
{
    "python_module" : "inference_process",
    "kratos_module" : "KratosMultiphysics.PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes.inference",
    "Parameters"    : {
        "model_part_name" : "ThermalModelPart",
        "model_settings"  : { "checkpoint_file" : "surrogate.pt", "device" : "cpu" },
        "input_fields"    : [ { "variable_name" : "HEAT_FLUX",   "data_location" : "node_historical" } ],
        "output_fields"   : [ { "variable_name" : "TEMPERATURE", "data_location" : "node_historical" } ],
        "execution_point" : "finalize_solution_step"
    }
}
```

*Variations:* `hybrid_initialization_process` warm-starts the solver from the
prediction instead of replacing it — often the better trade, since you keep the
solver's convergence guarantee and only spend fewer iterations getting there.
For meshes, grids, point clouds or time series, swap in the matching process
from [Where things live](Module_Map.html).

## 5. Decide whether to believe it

A surrogate that runs is not a surrogate that works.

```json
{
    "python_module" : "validation_metrics_process",
    "kratos_module" : "KratosMultiphysics.PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes",
    "Parameters"    : {
        "model_part_name"   : "ThermalModelPart",
        "list_of_comparisons" : [ {
            "predicted_variable" : "TEMPERATURE",
            "predicted_location" : "node_historical",
            "reference_variable" : "TEMPERATURE_REFERENCE",
            "reference_location" : "node_historical",
            "metrics"            : [ "mse", "rmse", "max_abs_error" ]
        } ],
        "output_file"       : "validation.json"
    }
}
```

Then, when the answer matters:

- **error bars** — the `"uncertainty"` block on any deployment process
  (MC dropout, a checkpoint ensemble, or a GP head);
- **a guard** — `"ood_guard"`, calibrated on the training inputs by `TrainModel`
  and checked per inference, so an input far outside the training distribution
  is flagged rather than silently extrapolated;
- **calibration metrics** — whether those error bars are honest at all.
