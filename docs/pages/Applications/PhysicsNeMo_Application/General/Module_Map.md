# Where things live

The application is a hundred-odd Python modules. This page is the map: what each folder is for, what is in it, and how to get from "I want to do X" to the module that does X.

## The folders

`python_scripts/` is a tree of packages, and the folder a module is in tells you what kind of thing it is.

| Folder | Contains | Import as |
|---|---|---|
| `processes/inference/` | run a trained model in the solution loop | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes.inference` |
| `processes/export/` | write solver data out as training data | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes.export` |
| `processes/` | adaptive remeshing, validation metrics, adjoint sensitivities | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes` |
| `bridges/` | convert Kratos data to and from PhysicsNeMo data | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.bridges` |
| `training/` | training loops, datasets, schemes | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.training` |
| `physics/` | residuals, PINN machinery, sensitivities | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.physics` |
| `deployment/` | checkpoints, cards, export, serving, uncertainty | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.deployment` |
| `distributed/` | MPI and multi-rank | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.distributed` |
| `active_learning/` | Kratos as the labeling oracle | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.active_learning` |
| `utilities/` | small shared helpers | `...PhysicsNeMoApplication.utilities` |

**The rule that keeps it navigable:** everything under `processes/` has a `Factory`, so it can be attached from `ProjectParameters.json`. Nothing outside `processes/` does. If you are looking for something to put in a process list, you only have to look in one place - and the [Process reference](Process_Reference.html) lists all twenty-six with their settings.

Each package's `__init__.py` carries a docstring saying what belongs in it — read that before adding a module.

## Attaching a process

```json
{
    "python_module" : "inference_process",
    "kratos_module" : "KratosMultiphysics.PhysicsNeMoApplication.processes.inference",
    "Parameters"    : { }
}
```

`kratos_module` names the **package**, `python_module` the module inside it. Getting the package wrong fails at run time, so the suite resolves every documented pair against the real tree.

## Tests and examples

- `tests/` mirrors the sources by name: `test_<module>.py`. Subdirectories (`tests/bridges/mesh_bridge/`, `tests/active_learning/`) are discovered automatically by the suite runner.
- `examples/notebooks/` — nineteen notebooks, executed by `tests/test_notebooks.py` so a changed signature breaks a test rather than rotting.
- The [Examples repository](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Examples/tree/master/physics_nemo_application) holds twenty-one fully documented use cases against real solves; both are indexed on [Examples](../Examples/Examples.html).

New here? [From scratch](From_Scratch.html) walks one path end to end. New to PhysicsNeMo itself? [PhysicsNeMo Basics](../PhysicsNeMo_Basics/Overview.html).
