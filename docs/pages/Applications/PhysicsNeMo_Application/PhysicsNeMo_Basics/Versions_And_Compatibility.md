# Versions and compatibility

This application is exercised against **physicsnemo 2.2.0**. Upstream's 2.2.1 is a fix-only release (Python 3.14 packaging and annotation introspection) and the 2.3.0 changelog is still empty, so 2.2 is the current surface. Where a page says an API "does not exist" or "raises", it means in 2.2.

## What is installed where this was written

The versions the test suite, the notebooks and the Examples cases were last run against. None of them is a *requirement* - the application declares no ML dependency at all (see [Overview](../General/Overview.html)) - but if something behaves differently for you, this is the baseline to compare with.

| Package | Version here | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `nvidia-physicsnemo` | 2.2.0 | everything ML |
| `torch` | 2.13.0 (CUDA 13.0 build) | everything ML |
| `tensordict` | 0.14.0 | the mesh tensorclass and datapipe samples; 2.2 requires `tensordict[zarr]>=0.14` |
| `warp-lang` | 1.16.0 | Warp kernels: ball query, SDF, remeshing, the FFD deformer; 2.2 requires `>=1.14` |
| `zarr` | 3.3.0 | mesh and datapipe Zarr I/O |
| `torch-geometric`, `torch_scatter` | 2.8.0, 2.1.2 | the graph processes (`PYG_AVAILABLE` upstream checks both) |
| `onnx`, `onnxscript`, `onnxruntime` | 1.22.0, 0.7.1, 1.29.0 | ONNX export (torch's exporter needs `onnxscript`) and CPU inference; the GPU build was verified once at 1.29.0 in a throwaway environment |
| `gpytorch` | 1.15.2 | the GP uncertainty head (`uq-extras`) |
| `pyvista` | 0.48.4 | mesh rendering, `cfd_bridge`, the notebooks' figures |
| `nvidia-physicsnemo-cfd` | 0.0.3a0 (source clone) | the CFD metric registry and hybrid initialization; not on PyPI |
| `tritonclient` | 2.71.0 | the Triton client (needs its protocol extra) |
| `cupy-cuda13x` | 14.1.1 | the opt-in array backend (upstream's `cu13` extra pins `<14`; 14.1.1 works here) |
| `usd-core` | 26.8 | OpenUSD export |
| `tetgen` | 0.8.4 | the opt-in exact-boundary tetrahedral fill (AGPL) |

Absent here, and the reason a few tests self-skip: `torch_sparse` and `dgl` (GraphCast), `onnxruntime-gpu` (kept out of the reference environment because it overwrites the CPU build file for file).

## The extras, and what each pulls in

`pip install "nvidia-physicsnemo[<extra>]"`. Read from the installed package's metadata:

| Extra | Pulls in | You want it for |
|---|---|---|
| `cu12` / `cu13` | `cuml`, `cupy`, `nvidia-dali`, `pylibraft` for that CUDA major, plus torch/torchvision | GPU-side data loading and clustering kernels; pick the one matching your driver |
| `mesh-extras` | `matplotlib`, `pyvista`, `vtk` | `physicsnemo.mesh` visualization and pyvista conversion |
| `datapipes-extras` | `dask`, `netcdf4`, `tfrecord`, `xarray`, `zarr` | the climate and Zarr readers |
| `gnns` | `torch-geometric`, `torch-scatter`, `torch-sparse`, `torch-cluster`, plus `pyvista`, `vtk`, `stl`, `scipy`, `mlflow`, `wandb` | every graph model; GraphCast needs `torch-sparse` |
| `model-extras`, `nn-extras`, `utils-extras` | `scipy`, `stl`, `vtk`, `mlflow`, `wandb`, `line-profiler` | logging and profiling helpers, STL I/O |
| `sym` | `sympy` | `physicsnemo.sym` (the module itself is bundled; only SymPy is extra) |
| `uq-extras` | `gpytorch` | the variational GP heads |
| `natten-cu12` / `natten-cu13` | `natten` | neighborhood attention layers |
| `transformer-engine-cu12` / `-cu13` | `transformer-engine[core,pytorch]` | `use_te=True` on Transolver-family models (fp8 attention) |

The core dependencies (always installed) include `torch`, `tensordict[zarr]`, `warp-lang`, `h5py`, `onnx`, `hydra-core`/`omegaconf`, `s3fs`/`fsspec`, `timm`, `nvtx`, `treelib` and `einops`.

## What changed from 2.1 to 2.2, as seen from this bridge

Every one of these either broke something here or would have. The lesson that recurs: **a layout change that keeps shapes identical passes every test whose fixture is symmetric.**

| Change in 2.2 | Effect on this application |
|---|---|
| Mesh-calculus gradients are derivative-first `(N, D, C)` from *every* backend (2.1's LSQ was channel-major) | `bridges.calculus_bridge` normalizes all backends to its own stable `(N, C, D)` contract and refuses physicsnemo older than 2.2 rather than guessing. All 469 tests of the time passed with the wrong layout because the canary gradient was a symmetric matrix; the canary is now asymmetric and non-square |
| `ShardTensor` moved from `physicsnemo.distributed` to `physicsnemo.domain_parallel` | `distributed.domain_parallel_utils` imports from the new location |
| `remesh` is Warp-backed (`pyacvd` dropped) and its count targets output *vertices*, not cells; it raises for anything but a surface in 3-D | `bridges.mesh_bridge.adaptive_remeshing` documents the new semantics; `remesh` still drops all point and cell data |
| `Mesh.save`/`load` gained a Zarr backend (`mesh.io.to_zarr`/`from_zarr`) | not yet used; the roadmap's curator-free Zarr export |
| GeoTransolver and FLARE promoted out of `experimental` (with `ShardTensor` support and activation checkpointing) | `processes.inference.point_cloud_inference_process` reaches both; the OOD guard was decoupled from GeoTransolver at the same time |
| `nn.functional.signed_distance_field` returns a 3-tuple `(sdf, hit_points, hit_faces)` | `bridges.mesh_bridge.spatial` unpacks it |
| `fill_interior` gained exact-boundary 2-D filling; its `n = 3` raises `NotImplementedError` | the tetrahedral fill in `bridges.mesh_bridge.generate` uses its own winding-number carve, with `tetgen` as the opt-in exact-boundary backend |
| `export_to_onnx_stream` no longer runs the model twice, but still exposes no `dynamic_axes` | `deployment.triton_export` keeps exporting through `torch.onnx.export` so the entity axis stays dynamic |
| `datapipes/protocols.py` rewritten (`_PrefetchResult` became `HostPayload`) | nothing here subclasses it; `training.streaming_dataset` inherits `IterableDatasetBase` and torch's `IterableDataset` together, which is unchanged |
| `integrate` gained `nan_policy`; `integrate_cell_data`/`integrate_point_data` deprecated in favour of `integrate(...)` | `bridges.calculus_bridge` uses `integrate` |
| The legacy diffusion modules (`samplers.legacy_deterministic_sampler`, `metrics.legacy_losses`, `preconditioners.legacy`) now warn they "will be deprecated in a future release" | the diffusion bridge still runs on them; migrating to the protocol API is the first item of the roadmap's upstream section |
| `shrink_and_perturb_`, the mesh deformers (`sobolev_deform`, `shrinkwrap`, RBF, FFD), the fixed-topology energies, the grid divergence/curl/Laplacian functionals, `farthest_point_sampling`, FSDP2 checkpoint support | the first four groups shipped here as `TrainModel`'s warm restart, the deformation layer, `grid_bridge`'s vector operators and `SaveTrainedModel`'s DTensor gather; the rest are roadmap items |
| `poisson_sample_indices_fixed` removed | unused here |

## How to check what you have

```python
import physicsnemo, torch, tensordict
print(physicsnemo.__version__, torch.__version__, tensordict.__version__)
```

The lazy-import helpers in every module produce an actionable message naming the missing package, so the fastest check of a fresh environment is simply running the small test suite and reading the skip reasons:

```bash
python3 applications/PhysicsNeMoApplication/tests/test_PhysicsNeMoApplication.py -l small
```

## Upgrading physicsnemo: compare skip counts, not pass/fail

Two things in this suite make a green run after an upgrade *insufficient* evidence:

1. **Optional-dependency gates skip green.** The graph, ONNX, Triton, GP-head, pyvista and cfd tests each self-skip when their import fails. If an upgrade renames a symbol the gate probes (the `PYG_AVAILABLE` flag, or the logger name the OOD guard capture keys on), whole classes turn into skips and the run stays green. Record the skip count before and after; it must not grow.
2. **Symmetric fixtures hide layout flips.** A unit cube hides every length scale, and a field with a symmetric gradient hides a transpose. The suite now carries asymmetric canaries and a non-unit extent for exactly this reason, but a new bridge you write should get one too.

The upstream [release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/physicsnemo/latest/release-notes/index.html) and the repository `CHANGELOG.md` list every change per release; the table above is the subset that touched this bridge.
